...And Howlin' At The Moon.
'Cause cheaters never win
'CAUSE EVERY SINCE I MARRIED HER, HERE'S ALL THAT SHE CAN SAY.
'Cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time
'Cause I just don't like this way of livin'.
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.
'Cause I know you'll break my heart.
'cause I won't be back no more,
'Cause I won't be home no more.
'cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.
'Cause if all these lies were true
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.
'Cause it knows I need you so
'cause it looks like rain
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight
'Cause My Bucket's Got A Hole In It
'Cause my head is startin' to bow
'Cause my heart would still want you-ooo-oo
'Cause ne'er again will I ask you to stay.
'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright nohow
'Cause soon his head - like mine will bow
'Cause that's the life I believe, He meant for me
'Cause the blues come around when the sun goes down
'Cause the night shift's waitin' for mornin'
'Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
'Cus she'll walk along beside me up the golden stairs
'mid the storm, a soldier lay
'N' the gambler's still waitin' for that Ace in the hole
'N' the hitch-hiker's waitin' for a ride
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone
'neath the palms tonight he's sleepin'
'til I found myself envired in a little colored pew.
'Your soul is God's, your mem'ry mine'
"My wife's been sick - the young'ns, too
"Oh! who was that brave girl so sweet?"
"Out in this cold wide world all alone
"Please buy a paper from me
"So please buy a paper from me
"That girl down the street should be run from our midst
"The bad girl who lived down the street."
"When they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave
(But) each time my dear it was worse than before
(like everybody else)
(Mind your own business)
(Oh you) know that I love you no other will do
(Oh you) know that I've come back and we've tried it o'er
(So) never again will I knock on your door
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
A car speeded by and the screamin' of brakes
A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch
A false goodbye a life is shattered
A garden's blooming there for me
A haul right off and count with me
A hound in the distance is starting to "bay"
A House Without Love is not a home.
A House Without Love is not a home.
A jug of wine to numb my mind
A lad stood alone in tears
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty
A lawyer proved I wasn't born
A life has gone out with the tide
A little fellow about my size got tired of being pushed about
A little girl prayed at the close of the day,
A long time ago
A love-light beams across the foam
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
A moonlit path that only she would know
A neighbor was passing my garden one time
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
A Prodigal son once strayed from his father
A slave too long to a heart of stone
A sobbing tear that follows parting
A solid-gold flame in my heart
A song I will sing
A song of old San Antone
A sound that made my blood chill
A sweatin' and swearin'
A THOUSAND TIMES MY POOR SOUL DIED,
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
A trusting heart had just been broken
About my daddy
After you're gone, when mem'ries come to haunt me
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
All alone I bear the shame
All alone without a friend
All because I loved no one but you.
All day I've faced the barren waste
All day long
All his treasures of diamonds and gold
All I can say's I tried dear
ALL I DO IS SET AND CRY,
All I do is sit and cry
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
All I need is a bride who want's a big-hearted groom
All my dreams have died and vanished
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
All my heart has lost a feeling
All my life I've been a loser
All my life I've been so lonesome
All she said was if you get blue,
All the happiness I've ever known
All the sunshine, all is gone
All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
All these blues that I've found
All these years how I've loved you
ALL THESE YEARS I'VE SET AND CRIED,
All you want to do is sit around and pout
All your dreams of heaven will come true on that day
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Although a million teardrops start to flow
AN KICKS HIS HEELS UP TO THE SKY
AN NEVER EVEN MOVE A HAIR
AN ON YA KNEES WHERE YOU WOULD PROPOSE
AN STICK YA FINGER IN YOUR EYE
AN WHEN HIS TAIL BEGINS TO SWISH
AN YA SWAT AT IT AS IT WIZZES BY
AN YOU TELL YA SELF TONIGHTS THE NIGHT
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry.
And a womans lies makes a life like mine
And all I do is moan ...
And all night long I've cried
And all of the things they will buy
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
And as I wonder where you are
And as the crowd came passin' by
And be on his way
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done
And Bill was just a usual dad
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
And buy me one for five or ten cents
And call around next May or June
And call my name
and carry on
And claim up your soul
And clouds overshadow the sky
And crave the love
And deny my God and doon my soul
and do it all up right
and don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best.
And don't mind if I start to weep
And drag you right down in disgrace
And drive your buggy back to town
And each precious vow you tried to keep
And even on the morning she became another's bride
And ever evenin' I'm sorrow bound
And ever since she let me down
And ever since she tore 'em down
And everlasting joys I'll reap
And every night I'll pray dear that
And experienced with a wife,
And for showin' us the way
And from way out in the darkness, see that headlight gleam
And get no lovin' in return
And get revenge by telling lies
And get that chip off of your shoulder
And he could not speak his name
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
And he let you keep and love it til your hearts were bigger grown
And he looked so satisfied
And he looked straight down at me
And he said, "Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay,
And he won't get a chance again,
And her name is Kathy Mae
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news
And here's the reason why I say
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
And hold you just the way I used to do
And how my heart weeps
And hung a sign on my front gate
And hurt her more each day
And I ain't got nothin' but time
And I ain't never been right;
and I began to dashin', Gettin' out of sight,
And I buried my heart with her
And i don't feel too sure
And I don't mean maybe
And I Just Don't Like This Kind Of Livin'.
And I just don't like this way of livin'.
And I knew just what it cost you
And I know a spot right over the hill
And i know i'll not be lonesome,
And i know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are,
And I know, people across the United States
And I shall spend eternity
And I stare at the water so deep
And I took a chance, and we happened to dance
And I was livin'g high until that fatal day
And I will never say I blame you
And I won't be home no more
And I won't be home no more.
And I'd bow my head and cry again
And I'll be left here all a- lone.
And I'll catch all the fish in the bayou
And I'll catch all the fish on the bayou
And I'll mend the heart that has been broken
And I'll never be bad no more
And I'll set as far back as I can."
And i'll shuffle down the aisle,
And I'll tell you right now honey that ain't all
And I'll walk along by my Jesus' side
And I'm contented just to roam
And I'm durn near - down with the flu
And I'm lo-o-onesome
And I'm lost on the river
And I'm never no more to mention his name
and I'm so doggone blue
and I'm telling you just what my love'll do
And I've been down that road before
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack
And if it all were true
And in early fall when brown leaves fall I'll catch a glimpse of you
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
And in my dreams you'll still belong to me
and it matters not what we go through
And it rains out here - nearly ever' day
And it seems all hope is gone
AND IT'S JUST ONE PESKY LITTLE FLY
And Jesus shall come to claim His own
And just how many tears are shed
And keep the homefires burnin'
And knelt beside her bed
And know that my poor soul was saved
And late in the evening
And leave these honky tonk blues,
And let someone trouble your mind
And live with Christ ever more.
And live with Him someday
And longs for the love he can't replace.
and look what you have loved me thru.
And make her do what's right
and mama would sing
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy
And my hair turns whiter than snow
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart is so sore,
And my heart's so sad, for the words I read there
And my Ma-in-law just moved in to stay
And my red rose is turning white.
And my tears they fell like rain.
And my way is clear and bright
And never comin' back
And never no more will I roam.
And no matter how much you boast and brag you can still learn a thing or two
And now I ain't gonna love you anymore.
And now I can see the end of my journey
And now I got enough and so I'm getting out
And now I know I was mistaken
And now I'll rock...yeah rock...
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
And now I'm Moanin'
And now I'm So Tired Of It All.
And now I've got another date
And now the bitter teardrops start
And now we sit together - on the running board.
And now we've reached the hour of parting
And on party nights when we come home she often sat and read
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
And our little home was like a paradise
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.
and perhaps those memories will always last
And Plea-ease - don't let me kiss you
And Plea-ease - don't let me love you
And Plea-ease - don't whisper sweetheart
And realized our dreams could never be
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
And said I must go west again
And saved by a girl lying still.
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
And scat right back to my pappy's farm
And see her love turn into sympathy
AND SETTLE DOWN TO SWEEP YA FLOORS
And she broke this heart of mine
And she thinks I'm "purty", too
and show us where
And since she's gone to Heaven
And slander your name all over town
And smile don't regret but live and forget
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
And so my poor dear mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And some mother rocked him, her darlin to sleep
And someday say - you win again.
and souls that cry
And stop this burnin', yearnin' while we're apart
And storms so violently sweep
And teach them how to bow their heads
And temptation comes your way
And that moonlit pass BY the Alamo
and that we two could get along
And that's all she wrote, Dear John,
And that's the only thing that counts
And the bride's Just Waitin' for June.
And the burglar Just Waitin' for night.
And the dark shadows creep
And the joy within me made my glad heart weep
And the last word led to a divorce
And the love light no longer shines
and the night before
And the soul of man never dies
And the soul.........never dies.
And their little daughter Sue
And then go home and pull my hair
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
And then I heard her whisper
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry
And then I took her in my arms,
And then I took the first year blues.
And then I went to meet her
and then maybe my heart
And then maybe these tears
And then she failed to shine my shoes,
And then she went and said goodbye
And then there was a silence
And then they all started to pray
And then we'll have some fun
And then you left me 'lone and blue
And then your lived ones
And there as I listened, my eyes filled with tears
And there in the moonlight I knew
And there on the the tomb, these words I read
And there'll be no quarralin'
And there's nothing I can do
And there's pictures of keys and of strife
And there's trouble in your soul
and these silver tears you're shedding now, is just interest on the loan.
And they had their little family quarrels
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street.
And things began to simmer down,
And think of my darlin'
And this is what I heard my neighbor say:
And tho I lost you to another
And tho I've lost you to another
And to him these words he did say.
And to ride these rails, 'neath God's blue sky
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
And took her, oh, so far away, but ol' KAW-LIGA stayed
And trials come no more
And try to sleep
And turn in fire alarms
AND WAIT AROUND FOR HIM TO LIGHT
And waited for your call
And watch the fellars in this town
and water.... cool, clear water.
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And we agree that love is gone
And we walk the streets of gold
And we'd listen to the waters
And we'll go Honky Tonkin', Honky Tonkin'
And we've chosen songs from the great Bob Wills
AND WHEN I ASKED HER TO LET ME IN, HERE'S ALL SHE SAID TO ME.
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh Lord
And when I'm go-one and at my grave you stand
And when our work is over heaven with Him we'll share
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go,
And when the whistle blows, I've gotta go,
AND WHEN YA JUST ABOUT TO DOSE...FLY TROUBLE
And when you're in that juryroom just remember there and then
And while the organ plays I love you truly
And wishes he was still an old pine tree.
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And writes my soul the message He wants me to know
AND YA LIGHT OF LOVE IS SHININ' BRIGHT
And yet she was once a true woman
And yet there's nothin' wrong with me
And you can call me any time
And you cheated on me from the start.
And you got no place to go
And you know you cause it all by telling lies
And you know you caused it all by telling lies
And you sit by yourself and pine
And you will hear Him if you'll just pray
And you'll almost lose your mind
And you're at your journey's end
And you're pillows stained with tears from your blue eyes
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years
And your friend(s) can not be found
And, honey, -- I'm -- Just -- Waitin' -- for -- you.
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
Another man's wife
Any time you wanna go
Are away beyond the skies
Are full of holes and nails
Are gathered to weep
Are the pictures from life's other side
Are you building a Home in Heaven
Are you doin' this for spite
Are you on the road that leads to wrong
Are you ready for His coming
are you talkin, (are you talkin)
Are you traveling in his light
Are you walkin and a talkin with the lord?
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord?
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord?
Are you walkin, (are you walkin)
Around me many are building
As day was drawing to a close...
As far as we in the business are concerned
As He hung there all alone
AS HE HUNG THERE ON THE TREE, HE PRAYED FOR YOU AND ME,
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you ...
As I helped him cross the highway
As I sit here alone in my cabin
As I stood alone, with mem'ries of home
As I stood by her bedside, those last few moments
As I travel down life's road
As i wander thru life alone.
As long as the sun is in the sky
AS THE BLOOD FLOWED FROM HIS SIDE.
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
As they go strollin' by
As they rippled soft and low
As though his heart would break
As we danced to the waltz of the wind
AS WE JOURNEY ALONG, ON LIFE'S WICKED ROAD,
As we pay tribute to one of the greatest of all time Bob Wills
As you journey day by day
As you travel day by day, down life's long highway
At first when I heard of some people who claim
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
At little Sue's expense
At night when I am sad and lonely
At someone else's side
At the break day
At the close of Ev'ry day
Aw! baby, baby, baby
Baby, I'll be your baby
Baby, it's time for me to rearrange
Baby, rock, let's rock on down the line
Baby, rock, rock on down the line
Baby, we fit like a glove
Baby, we're really in love
Baby, we're really in love.
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Be careful of stones that you throw.
Be forgivin to the wayward
Be on your way, that's all she wrote
Be prepared to go, there's one thing I know
Because his heart was made of knotty pine.
Because it died When we were apart
Because it isn't true
Because she worshipped you
Because to us, that's just what he is
Because you're sweet dear, I want to love you
Bees Just Waitin' for honey
BEFORE HE DIED, HE FAINTLY CRIED,
Before it is too late
Before it steals their fate
Before you ask for more.
Believed each alibi
Beneath the cold clay
Beneath the stars all alone
Better pack up your suitcase and leave in a hurry
Beyond the sunset oh blissful morning when with our Saviour heaven is begun
Both footsore and weary I rested awhile
Bouncy-bouncy, (Rootie Tootie)
Bowls up weeds and does the chores run both ways to Holday's stores
Boy you can't win no matter if you're right
Boys it's a lot easier on the head and eyes I've been down that road before
Bringin' my darlin' back home,
Broken song, empty words I know
Built it on hope and the love I thought was true
But - we're still a-livin' - so EVER'THING'S Okay.
But - we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days
But a divorce never stops to consider
but a tear came and he whispered, "I want my parents too".
But after I die in the electric chair
BUT ALL OF HIS WEALTH, WILL BE LEFT BEHIND.
But all of my hopes for treasures
But be sure to count your blessin's
But could not face fact, somehow
But darlin' I'll forget you, your memory will die
But dear I hope you're happy just the same
But deep inside the sorrow shows
But don't trust any woman you meet
But ever since she left this town
but his shore 'nough father wanted him in the big house up above.
But honey among tigers you'd be queen
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred
But I bowed that time, he got started to preach
But I can't get you off of my mind.
But I don't take no one's advice
But I done let the deal go down
But I found I couldn't hide
But I got it the hard, hard way
But I got rockin' chair money, honey
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
But I just go to sleep praying
But I knew her love would never set me free
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
But I know a guy that didn't try to get along,
But I know a man that didn't try to get along,
But I know she waits and prays
But I let a gal make a fool of me
But I said, "It won't hurt me I'll just step inside
But I'd be just as blue
But I'm just tryin' to be helpful cause I've been down that road before
But I'm learnin' how to count in rhyme
But I'm satisfied with you.
But I'm sure the truth would show
But I've seen my blue skies all turn to gray
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
But if that little old gal of mine,
But if this road don't start to get smooth
But in my dreams you still belong to me
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
But it can't chill my heart
But it gives you misery
But it just don't matter now
But it's sure better than no house at all
But just before I reached the end
But last night I heard you crying in your sleep
But love to you was just a song
But mosey around with my head in my hands
BUT MY FRIENDS IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
But my tears I can't hide
But neither one really got mad
But nobody dreams about me
But nobody thinks about me
But nobody's crazy 'bout me
But nobody's fallin' for me
But nobody's lonesome for me
But nobody's lonesome for me.
But now I know I was just dreaming
But now I know I was mistaken
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
But now I'll tell you about one all the southern folks have seen
But now I'm So Tired Of It All
But now she's gone and I'm alone
But now the future looks so dark and cold
But now you are gone it's over and so
But now you are gone it's over I know
But now you've gone dear, breakin' my heart
But now your conscience bothers you
But one word led to another
But she don't care about me
But she just wouldn't stay
BUT SHE QUICKLY TURNED AWAY, AND THEN SHE TOLD ME THIS.
BUT SHE WENT AND CHANGED HER MIND, HOW I REGRET THAT DAY,
But she went to heaven, just one year ago
But sleep won't come
But some glad day I'm going home
But someday you'll wish that I still care.
But still you blame me for all
But still you had your way
But tell her I'll be waiting for her
But that was before
But that won't worry me
But that's all done, I've changed my mind
BUT THE DEBT CAN'T BE PAID, WITH SILVER AND GOLD,
But the Devil said, "Don't you go in!"
But the last three is killin' me,
BUT THEIRS A FLY THAT'S A LIVEN RIGHT
But then you changed dear, you found someone new
But there'll be no teardrops tonight.
But there'll be no teardrops tonight.
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street.
But they'll never never take her love from me.
But to me somehow it don't matter
But today I'm saying my first prayer
But today you're all alone and broken hearted
but together, we can find a brighter way.
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
But we got married on the Tennessee Border.
But we quarled and now we're through my little darlin'
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
But we'll meet again some day.
But wedding bells will never ring for me
But what good does it do
But what good would it do
But what of a home in Heaven
BUT WHEN HIS MUSCLES START TO TWITCH
But when I get to heaven
But when I got all thru
BUT WHEN I TRIED TO HOLD HER HAND,
But when that open ro-oad starts to callin' me
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
But where I go, I always know
BUT YOU HAVE TREATED ME SO BAD,
But you hurt yourself instead,
But you know you caused it all by telling lies
But you never give your heart
But you think that you're above me
But you wouldn't let it be
But you're as sweet as you can be
But your wife has done been in,
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE FLY
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE PEST
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE THING
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ HE'S TAKIN OFF AN HIDE
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ THAT MULE CAN'T GET NO REST
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ YOU SWAT AN LOOSE THE RING
By some little word of anger
By the singin' waterfall
By the singin' waterfall.
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
Calling for you (my brother) don't turn away (from Jesus)
Came in last night about a half past ten
came the day you said you'd be my own
Can you face them and say
Can you smile and say
Can you truthfully say
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
CAUSE HE'S A BULKY STUBORN FOOL
Cause he's just a helpless servant to a master that he serves
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
Cause I ain't gonna call you any more.
Cause I ain't gonna love you anymore
Cause I know you're living in sorrow
Cause I love to rock, yeah rock
Cause I love to rock...yeah rock...
Cause I tell you right now the hide's gettin' sca'ce
cause I'm cryin' for you dear
cause I'm crying for you dear
cause I'm crying' for you dear
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink
Cause it just don't matter now
Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Cause you can't mend my broken heart
Change the things you do
Colorado and Nevada through the deserts burnin' door
Comes down after you
Could hear little Sue say
Countin' numbers 1-2-3
Crazy words don't mean a thing
Cry, oh, lord.
Cut like a knife
Dan's feet are sore he's yearnin' for
Daniel in the lion's den,
Dark is the night
Darlin I could never be ashamed of you
darlin I could never be ashamed of you.
Darlin' if our romance ends let us be the best of friends
Darlin', if our pathways part, let there be no broken hearts
Darlin', if our romance ends, let us part the best of friends
Darling let's turn back my years and go back to yesterday
Darling that you went away
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you.
Darling, someday when your memories wander
days we could recall if you would only try dear
Dear Brother, Mama left us this morning
Dear friend there'll be no sad farewells
Dear, I must throw your things away
Death may be lingering near.
Death's angels took her away
Deep in my heart, there's a burnin'
Deep within my heart lies a melody
DID YOU EVER SEE A JASS ACK CRY
Did you ever see a robin weep
DID YOU EVER SIT STRAIGHT UP IN BED
Didn't think you would leave me behind
Do you recall when we parted
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
DO YOU WANT TO MARRY, GOT NO TIME TO TARRY,
dollar weighs ten, dollar weighs ten
Don't come back now It is too late
Don't come back now on your knees
Don't forget his darkness just before the break of dawn wait for the light to shine
Don't forget your brother as you travel through this land wait for the light to shine
Don't hurt me more, show my heart some respect.
Don't let trouble fool you and your sin will all be gone wait for the light to shine
Don't mind these tears there in my eyes
Don't say you care, you know that you'll be lying
Don't they know on the judgement day
Don't worry, 'cause I ain't got no wife
down behind the trees and the moon is slowly rising
Down beneath the clay
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Drag it on over (move it on over)
Dreams that will never come true
Dress in style and go hog wild me oh my oh
Drifting alone
Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Each eye looked toward the west
Each night I laid there in prison
Each night when the pale moon is shining
Each star's a pool of water... cool, clear water.
Each thing you've touched along the way will be a hallowed spot
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away.
Each year on Mother's day
Early next mornin' as the crowd passed by
Earth's toiling ended oh glorious dawning beyond the sunset when day is done
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down
Ev'ry thing I loved, I lost, dear
Ev'ry time you get mad
Ev'rybody's crazy 'bout somebody else
Ev'rybody's dreamin' about somebody else
Ev'rybody's fallin' for somebody else
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else
Ev'rybody's longin' for somebody else
Ev'rybody's pinin' for somebody else
Ev'rybody's thinkin' 'bout somebody else
Ev'rybody's waitin' for som'thin'
Ev'rybody's yearnin' for somebody else
Ev'rything's again' me and it's got me down
even though you proved to be untrue
Ever get's a-hold of me,
Ever since the day you set me free
every day and every night
Every fuss with a woman has got the same ole end
Every hound in the country would crawl off and hide
Every morning
Every morning he'd run
Everybody says you let me down
Everyday you'll know I'll miss you
Everyone here tried to warn me
Everything I love is gone
Faded love and winter roses always bloom in memory
Faded love and winter roses live and die in memory
Faded love and winter roses sprinkled with a lonely tear
Faded love and winter roses still recall each yesteryear
Faded love and winter roses yearning hearts that used to be
Fall down on your knees and pray
False love like ours fades with the flowers
Far away from friends and loved ones
Farmer's daughter's waitin' for the salesman
FATHER FORGIVE THEM PLEASE.
Feelin' dandy, doin' swell
Filled with selfishness and greed
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
FOR ALL OF OUR WRONGS, THEN WE MUST PAY,
For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
For another to be in my place.
For ev'ry wrong some day you'll pay
For he had just said goodbye
For He spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by.
For he was the one ray of sunshine
For He's coming someday, to bear your soul away
For His sufferin' on that day
For I don't want be seen here at all."
For I know it just can't be
For I know my prayers have not been in vain
For I know she's waiting up there
For I know that you'll never be true
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
For just that weak-minded I feel."
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
FOR MY FRIEND IT WON'T SAVE YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
FOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH EARTHLY WEALTH YOU GET HOLD,
for right there was my honey,
For someday down that lonely road you'll hear me call your name
For someday you ´ll have to pay
For someday you'll find that I'm not there.
For someday you'll find yourself alone.
For that day when Christ shall come
For the city where is no pain.
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts
for the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away.
For the love that's beating there
For the while my love is sleeping
For the words said, Mother is gone.
For they know not what they do
For they would only bring me pain
For time has prove I was wrong
For time has proven I was wrong
for water... cool, clear water.
For we may never meet again."
For wealth and what it will buy
FOR WHEN GOD CALLS, FROM HIS HOME UP ON HIGH,
For when she went away, my world ended that day
For years I've lived without a meaning
For years we both have lived on pride, dear
For you are the one I want, my darlin', can't you see
For you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
Forever, so long I've been yearnin'
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love.
From jail on a West Texas plain
From out of the sky, He's coming to meet me
From the Dear Saviour; who's pleading today
From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah to California's golden shore
From the start to the VJ day
From this world I'll soon be goin'
Gathered 'round him all his buddies
Gentlemen of the jury the judge's speech began
Gently rocked my baby cradle
Get on your knees and pray.
Get the supper on the table
Give me back the winter roses and the love you took away
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Go and leave me alone with the blues
Go and leave me alone with these blues
Go get you some treatments just like I've had and you won't hanker for more
Go on an break you Crazy Heart.
Go on an break, you Crazy Heart
Go on and break you Crazy Heart.
Go tell your troubles to the moon
God bless His Holy name
God called dad to go
God certainly got a hold of me.
God forgive me if I cry.
God has saved her wand'ring boy.
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep
God knows it died the day you left
God only knows how it hurts me
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
Golden hair and big blue eyes she could win a beauty prize
Gonna make that lady mine
Good gal, just let me know
Goodbye Joe me gotta go me oh my oh
Goodbye to the fields, that I used to roam
Goodbye to this world, with all its sorrows
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,
Got in trouble had to roam
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
Got pounds of candy kisses, but I can't spare an ounce
got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.
Grab your dancin' shoes
Graves all bursting Saints a shouting
Hang the scenes that're painted from life
haul up on a crack up on a wheelbarrow blackstone
Have really got me down
Have you been true all along
Have you finished your building in Glory
He acts like his head was only made to hold his ears apart
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He couldn't know, I was crying inside
HE CRIED THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND,
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.
He died there on the cross
He died with the papers under his head
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
He has give us many comforts, he's got the right to take away
He has said "Be ye not troubled for these things shall come to pass."
He held and caressed it, and gazed up above
he just thought you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while.
He likes everything from a soup to hay
HE LIKES TO LOOK AT YU AND GLARE
He loved every footstep, he loved every curl
He may be in trouble and may need a helping hand wait for the light to shine
He never stopped prayin' for me
He rubbed his chin - here's what he had to say.
HE SAID THE TROUBLE WITH YOU AIN'T IN MY BOOK,
HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AN BATS HIS EYE
He shed his lifes blood for you and for me
He smiled as we parted, cause he didn't know
He sounds too blue to fly
He spoke of his angel, a dear baby girl
He spreads the burnin' sand with water.
He still had the dolly, that she used to love
He stood all alone with his head bowed down
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was
He told me a story,of sorrow and woe
He walked every step up Calvary's ragged way
He was doing very finely and he appreciates your love,
he was marys own darlin, he was gods chosen son
He was only a tramp found dead on the street.
he was some mothers darlin, he was some mothers son
He was tortured and slain
He wears up that apetite that way
He whispered my baby, your waiting I know
He who lay down at the rich mans gate
He will always guide you right
He will brighten up your way
He will take you by the hand
He'd grab his lunch bucket
He'll give his heart - but all in vain
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face
He's repeating these words he was told.
He's the devil, not a man.
Headin' south from Caroline
Heading for the pearly gates for there my savior waits
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
Heart filled with strife
Heaven holds all my treasures
Heavenly beauty all around
Her children safe from harm throughout the years tand then she went to sleep
Her eyes began to blinkin' and that gal broke in - to.
Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone.
Her mama said: "No-o, she's my only daughter,"
Her personality made me want her
Her smile was like an angel fair
Her time has come to go
Here comes the log train
Here with the shadows around me
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.
Hey Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters hungry every minute of the day
Hey, sweet baby - don't you think maybe
Hi, neighbors, this is our new album
Higgama, jiggama, horney cuff,
Hinky-dinky, (Rootie Tootie)
His blood washed all my sins away
His frail body trembled, he spoke soft and low
His Garments were sackled, all tattered and torn
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
His heart went to heaven,at the first fall of snow
His life's blood almost gone
His servants will bring, a ring for my finger
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
HIT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT FLY
Holds all the pain that sorrow knows
Homes of beauty and wealth
Honey baby, please come home
Honey do you have to love so doggone rough
HONEY DO YOU LOVE ME, HUH, HONEY DO YOU LOVE ME, HUH,
HONEY DO YOU LOVE ME, HUH, QUIT YOUR HESITATIN',
HONEY WON'T YOU HOLD ME TIGHT, HONEY WON'T YOU HOLD ME TIGHT,
HONEY WON'T YOU HOLD ME TIGHT, START YOUR TURTLE DOVEIN'
Honky tonk blues,
Honky Tonkin', Honey Baby
Hoping and prayin' some day you'd be true
Hotsy-totsy (Rootie Tootie)
HOW CAN YOU REFUSE HIM NOW, HOW CAN YOU REFUSE HIM NOW,
HOW CAN YOU REFUSE JESUS NOW.
HOW CAN YOU TURN AWAY FROM HIS SIDE,
How come you find so many faults with me
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
How I wish I could repay
How many fingers do I hold up
How she cried when I left her
How's about cooking somethin' up with me?
How's about saving all your time for me?
Hows about keepin' steady company?
Humpty-dumpty, (Rootie Tootie)
Hunky-dory, (Rootie Tootie)
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
I asked him how he'd been - since last, I'd passed his way
I ASKED MY GAL TO MARRY ME, RECKON WHAT SHE SAID,
I been in the doghouse so doggone long
I been lovin' that gal for so doggone long
I believed the lies you told to me
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails
I bet I'll have to go and hire me someone to cry
I bowed my head and cried again
I built a dream world darlin' for two
I built a world for us together
I built a world in my heart
I built my castles very high
I can plow and milk the cow
I can see the light of day
I can see your mansion on the hill
I can settle down and be doin' just fine
I can speak my name aloud
I can't afford to lose her now
I can't buy no beer.
I can't buy no beer.
I can't escape from you.
I can't even spell my name, my heads in such a spin
I can't fool my cryin' heart
I can't forget lovin' you
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You ...
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You.
I can't keep the tears from my eyes
I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke
I could give you all the blame
I could hate you for theway I'm feelin'
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips,
I could say it's over now
I could say that someone put me wise
I could shame you 'til you hide your face
I could smile and say that I don't care
I could tell my friends I threw you down
I could tell my heart I'm glad we parted
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you
I could tell the world you're doin' wrong
I could tell this world I've found a new love
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
I covered the crushed, broken body and said:
I cried again when I reached home
I don't aim to meddle in your business I'm just tryin' to save you an awful price
I don't believe the good Lord meant for a man to win
I don't care if tomorrow never comes
I don't care who thinks we're silly you'll be daffy and I'll be dilly
I eat three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a 'Coon
I even bought a little band of gold
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
I feel like a honey bee, when she's buzzing round with me
I feel so sorry for you Hank,
I fought in every battle
I found myself a'bleedin', and very much a'needin',
I gave up my friends, I left my home
I gave you my love, never thought that we'd part
I give my all and sit and yearn
I got a blue love in my heart.
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
I got a hot rod Ford, and a two dollar bill
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high,
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.
I got the honky tonk blues,
I got the lovesick blues
I got them gone but not forgotten blues
I guess I was too young to know
I guess it just don't matter now
I guess Jack's still waitin' for Jill.
I guess that I - should not complain
I guess the early bird's waitin' for the worm.
I had lot's of luck but it's all been bad
I had me a woman who couldn't be true
I hate to think it all over
I hate to think it's all over
I have heard your stories about your fast trains
I have no mother, nor even a dad"
I have no place on this earth to call home
I have shed a million tears.
I have the invitation that you sent me
I haven't had the chance that other kids had
I hear the children laughing out with glee
I heard her say, "I'll meet you someday,
I heard my darlin' call
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I heard the angels singing songs of peace and rest
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years,
I hope that you'll forgive me for in-truding like this,
I is one and X is ten
I just can't go - you win again.
I just can't go on, dear, with tears in my eyes
I just can't help lovin' you
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
I just couldn't tell her that I ran away
I just don't like the things you're doin'
I Just Don't Like This Kind Of Livin'
I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happi-ness,
I just keep Moanin'
I kept my vows you left me all alone
I knew not where the road would end
I knew she was part of, his happier years
I knew someday that you would wed another
I knew the way
I knew when I first met you that you'd be my sweetheart
I knew you couldn't win, I told you from the start
I knew you'd wake up and find her missin'
I know I can never make you happy
I know I couldn't love you as before.
I know I'd still want you-ooo-oo
I know I'd still want you-oooo-oo
I know I'd still want you.
I know it filled her heart with pain
I know nothing but sorrow
I know that I - should leave, but then
I know that I would never be this blue
I know that she's waiting in vain
I know that you'll never be true
I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in
I know we'll both be all alone
I know you tried your best to love me
I know you're alone with your pride dear
I know you're gonna love me after all
I leave you the day, to help all your neighbors
I leave you the night, to solemnly pray
I left her alone without saying goodbye
I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sake
I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sakes
I lived my childhood again
I love to see the towns a-passin' by
I love you baby, but you gotta understand
I love you dear but you are wed
I love you so much I want you happy
I love you still - you win again.
I love you, so swing wide your gate of love
I loved, I lost, my story ended
I made a mistake, dear, by tellin' you lies
I mean I ain't gonna love you anymore,
I met a man and he was blind
I miss her most of all
I must learn to live without you
I NEED A LITTLE LOVIN', HONEY WON'T YOU HOLD ME TIGHT.
I need not feel my way
I never knew i loved you so;
I NEVER KNEW LIVIN' COULD BE SO SAD,
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
I often sit and wonder
I often wonder if it's all a mistake;
I patted his shoulder, my feelings to hide
I picked her up in a pickup truck
I pictured a future so bright
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I pray the Lord to set me free
I prayed in my heart I would never be found
I prayed there and God had His way. (For-)
I promise you baby that I'll be good
I pulled 'im up and I hollered WHOA!, said fill 'im up with gas
I really learned the meaning of living and loving I've been down that road before
I remember back when you were nice and sweet
I remember how my Savior died
I returned home, but I waited too long
I rocked away out on the ocean
I rocked from here and there
I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass
I run around in circles
I said "I'll go down, take a look at the crowd
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
I said they'll never never take her love from me.
I said, "It's commotion, that's all."
I sat in my seat just thinkin' it o'er
I saw a teardrop on a rose.
I saw a young man kneelin' there
I saw all the joys of life fade far away
I saw saw your love dear, fade and die away
I saw the light I saw the light
I scratched your name right off my slate
I seen the crabs and the fishes - Doin' the be-bop-bee.
I stand on the banks of the river
I started rolling down that lost highway
I STAYED OUT TOO LATE LAST NIGHT, ON A LITTLE SPREE,
I still recall his words today.
I stood around a month or two
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
I talked with a stranger, so sad and alone.
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom
I thought I heard her whisper welcome home my boy
I thought I was right but I must of been wrong
I thought I'd make her happy if I stepped aside
I thought of things that might have been
I thought of you Brother and of the old homestead
I thought our worlds were the same
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
I Told A Lie To My Heart.
I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days
I told my heart I didn't love you
I told my paw I'm going steppin out and get the
I told them all we were meant for each other
I took your letters from the shelf
I traveled from Texas to old Louisanne
I tried my best to warn you, but you wouldn't listen
I tried so hard,my dear,to show that you're my every dream
I tried to but I couldn't wait
I used to be the patient kind
I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door
I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I want to ho hold you close to my heart...
I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
I want to live and love always
I want to live and love under the stars above
I was a fool to wander and a-stray
I was afraid to scold her, so I just gently told her,
I was born in dixie in a boomer's shack,
I was just a lad, nearly 22
I was only hatched
I was ridin' number nine
I was sad and blue, I was down-hearted, too
I was there with my Saviour free from grief and strife
I was walking in Savannah past a church decayed and dim
I watched my dream world crumble like clay
I watched you as you held his hand
I went and broke my darlin's heart
I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night
I went to the country - just the other day
I WENT TO THE RIVER, BUT THE WATER'S TOO COLD,
I wish I had a nickel, for every tear you shed last night.
I wish that I was with my darling
I wish to my soul you'd slow down the pace
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of
I wouldn't care if she come ridin' in on a broom
I wouldn't have a pocket in my patched up pants
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
I wrote a nice, long letter
I'd be the first to take your part
I'd like to tell you a story
I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
I'd rather have you just the way that you are
I'll always be the same old pal,
I'll always keep your picture it means so much to me
I'll be locked here in this cell
I'll be with my baby, at the first fall of snow
I'll be your baby
I'll be your darlin'
I'll believe that you still love me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll bring you your dolly, at the first fall of snow
I'll crawl back to her on my knees
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll even do the churnin'
I'll even make believe I never loved you
I'll even make believe I never loved you
I'll gas up my hot rod stoker we'll get hotter than a poker
I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
I'll guarantee you boys I didn't get them there lyin' at home in the bed
I'll have a new body
I'll have a new body
I'll have a new home of glory eternal
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
I'll hide my tears and say I'm Free At Last.
I'll just set back and watch you,
I'll just set back and watch you, while you shed those bitter tears.
I'll keep it till it's covered with age
I'll listen for whistle
I'll live in mem'ry's garden dear with happy days we've known
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller settin' the woods on fire
I'll meet my loved ones all once again
I'll meet my loved ones there, in that land so bright and fair
I'll miss you but no one will ever know
I'll ne'er forget that sad, sad day
I'll never get out of this world alive
I'll never see that gal of mine
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
I'll soon get my big check, baby
I'll still be waiting for you
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
I'll tell then I found true love with another
I'll tell you right now I've had enough of that
I'll tell you right now, Lord my bucket's 'bout full
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT IT AIN'T GOOD NEWS,
I'll try to repay
I'll wake up tomorrow, with tears in my eyes
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
I'm a number not a name
I'm a rollin stone all alone and lost
I'm a-gonna do some riding on the midnight train
I'm a'headin' back to dixie,
I'm alone and oh, so blue tonight
I'm footloose and I'm fancy free
I'm free and ready, so we can go steady.
I'm Free At Last don't ask me why I'm cryin'
I'm Free At Last from love and all its' worries
I'm Free because you wanted it that way
I'm gettin' sick and tired of the same ole bull
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice
I'm going away where, life is eternal
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm going to heaven again.
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice
I'm gonna keep drinkin'
I'm gonna keep drinkin' till I can't even think
I'm gonna let the hallelujahs ring
I'm gonna praise my blessed Saviour's name
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
I'm hoping and praying someday to return
I'm leaving now
I'm like a weepin-willow, while we're apart
I'm like a weepin'-willow, while we're apart
I'm lonesome and O how I feel
I'm lost on the river
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
I'm not jealous, no siree
I'm not the kind of guy to let you down
I'm nutty as a fruitcake
I'm on my way to that fair land
I'm satisfied with you.
I'm sentenced to die at dawn
I'm sittin' here waitin' for you right now
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so sick and tired of scheming
I'm so sorry dear to say we're not together
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
I'm sorry for - your victim now
I'm Sorry For You, My Friend.
I'm taking everything except my ball and chain
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
I'M TIRED OF WAITIN', HONEY DO YOU LOVE ME, HUH.
I'm traveling in the light
I'm waitin' for a woman - That ain't got no man.
I've been a fool about you, but I'm gonna get gone
I've been a fool about you, but now I'm gonna get gone
I've been a fool about you, for way too long
I've been lonely night and day ever since you went away
I've disgraced your name I know
I've fetched your saddle home.
I've got a blue love in my heart
I've got a blue love in my heart.
I've got an old flame in my heart
I've got new fish to fry
I've got the freight train blues, lordy, lordy, lordy,
I'VE GOT THE MEAN OLD MISERIES IN MY SOUL,
I've got to get rollin'
I've grown so used to you somehow
I've had it proven to me,
I've just been to heaven with someone so true I dreamed about mama last night
I've just told Mama goodbye
I've lost faith in dreams somehow
I've lost my heart it seems
I've never seen a night so long
I've sent your saddle home.
I've told you once, now I'll tell you twice
I've traveled it long enough;
I've tried and tried to run and hide
I've waited all through the years love
I'VE WALKED THE FLOOR 'TILL I'VE WORE OUT MY SHOES,
I´ll carry you to a home on high
If a poor little rabbit had you on his side
If happpiness came, I missed the call
If I can stand the next six, my friends all say I'll be fixed,
If I ever lose her I'll lay me down and die
If I jumped in the river I would prob'ly drown
If I said I'm happy to be free
If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three
If it be across the deep blue sea
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin
If it was rainin' gold I wouldn't stand a chance
If just a few parted parents
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
If she'd sing until I'm sleepin'
If sugar seems sweet then you ought to meet
If the judge says pay her forty dollars a week
If the night is dark, you will soon see the day
If the things I said was to break your heart
If the wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right
If they could but understand
If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
If tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever shine
If we sin somehow we pay
If you can't treat me right then get out of my life
If you do her wrong she'll leave this tonw
If you ever need me, oh please let me know
If you find you're friendless on that weary lonesome road wait for the light to shine
If you go for me like i go for you
If you go to the city then you will find me there
If you heart said testify, would the world hear your reply
If you just look around
If you love me half as much as I love you
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
If you make a snake mad he's sure gonna bite
If you make your baby mad and she says goodbye
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.
If you mind your own business, you'll stay busy all the time.
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you only want to hurt me
If you ride that Devil's Train
If you say so babe, we'll stay all night
If you stay over in your world
If you take time to look
If you want a good gal to stay around
If you will listen
If you'll be a baby to me
If you'll follow Him each day
If you'll follow in His light
If you'll just travel in His light and pray both day and night
If you're countin' on me like i'm countin' on you
If you're dreamin' of me like i'm dreamin' of you
If you're grateful for their vict'ries
If you're happy with me like i'm happy with you
If you're lost in sin. there's no need for you to stay
If you're lovin' me like i'm lovin' you
If you're meant for me like i'm meant for you
If you're not saved; you'll be lost in the night
If you're thinkin' of me like i'm thinkin' of you
If your ever in the south lands and want to see the scenes
If your heart's not good and true
If your hungry heart forgets, let there be no sad regrets
In a little country village
In a little pine grove by the old home
in a long, long while
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
In his hand, there were some roses
In life and love, I've been a failure
In Life's many battles that you will have to fight
In my dreams you still belong to me
In my dreams you're still my only darlin'
In my heart, I know that you'll come through
In old Alabam'
In our Savior's blessed words He said on earth, He prophesised,
In spring I'll wait for roses red when fades the lilacs bloom
In that fair homeland we'll know no parting beyond the sunset for evermore
In the bible, God's own words do say
In the Book of Revelation, words in chapter sixteen say
In the distance hear her moanin' hear her lonesome whistle scream
In the great book of John
In the mountains far away
In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
In this wicked ole world today
In this wicked world of sin
In this world I'm left to wander
In this world of greed and hate will you wait til it's too late
In this world of grief and sorrow
In this world of sorrow, I've seen trouble and woe
In this world, I'm just a drifter
In your loveless mansion on the hill
Into these last nine beers
Is better than totin' a gun
Is it any wonder that his face is red
Is love her ev'ry mornin', bawl her out at night
Is work on your home completed
It hurts me to know you are unhappy
It looks to me like I been cheated out of my rib
IT MADE YOU GLAD TO SEE ME SAD,
It made you stop and realize
It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
It offers you temptation
It rides on rails of fear
It seemed like the whole world was lost
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
It seems my life is through
It seems that fate has made a vow
It shines to light the fires of home
It should have been a tear of gladness
It was nothing of course
It was there I found beside the Alamo
It was there I knew I'd love you forever
It wasn't in you to play square.
It will fill her heart with joy
It won't matter with me
It would ease this awful pain
It'll be fought at Armageddon, it shall be a sad, sad day.
It's a sin to make me cry
It's beautiful to see
It's got a burnin', yearnin' while we're apart
It's hard to believe that it's true.
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
It's hard to know you don't want me
It's headin' for destruction now
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
It's just a picture from life's other side
It's on its way to heaven now
IT'S OVER NOW AND I'M SO GLAD,
It's rocky and it's rough
It's that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.
It's the California Zephyr, the Union Pacific Queen
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
It's then I really know you're gone
It's waiting there for you and me
Its gotta stop, I don't mean plea-ease
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filé gumbo
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie..
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie...
Jesus died for me long ago
Jesus died there on the cross
Jesus is calling, calling night and day
Jesus said ,come on to me
jesus, he died on calvarys tree
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
Just a kid actin' smart
Just a little old shanty by a railroad track,
Just a picture from life's other side
Just a spark of the love that used to be
Just a-Waitin' for the grass to turn green.
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just as easy as A-B-C
Just as in years gone by,
Just as long as she's with me
Just because I'm feelin' blue
Just by chance I passed a graveyard
Just call me up sweet mama and we'll go steppin' out
Just come along with me
Just get your self a ticket on that Pan American Queen
Just give me a ring
Just hang your little head and cry,
Just how many homes are broken tonight
Just how much mama worried when we children were away
Just like a blind man I wandered along
Just like she used to do
Just like the blind
Just like you used to be
Just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all,
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just mind your own business
Just one thing more than water.... cool, clear water.
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son
Just say God called home your Ra-amblin' Man
Just stay close to Jesus and journey in His light
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow's way,
Just trusting you - was my great sin
Just Waitin' to get a finger in the pie
just waiting by your telephone
Just Window Shoppin'
Katy, she's waitin' at the garden gate
KAW-LIGA - A, just stands there as lonely as can be
KAW-LIGA - A, just stood there and never let it show
KAW-LIGA - A, too stubborn to ever show a sign
KAW-LIGA, that poor ol' wooden head.
KAW-LIGA, was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
KAW-LIGA, was a wooden Indian standing by the door
Keep a-movin' Dan. Don't you listen to him Dan.
Keep movin' along
Keep these wordson your mind as you walk out narrow line wait for the light to shine
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Last night as I lay dreamin'
Last night I dreamed of heaven and I saw my mother there
Last night I dreamed of heaven and it filled my heart with joy
Last night I dreamed of heaven my eternal home sweet home
Last night I dreamed of heaven that land so pure and sweet
Last night I dreamed of heaven the land of eternal life
Last night I walked the floor
Later on, swap my mon, get me a pirogue
Lawd, the blues come around
Lead you to that promise land
Leave the best friend, I ever had.
Leave the road of sin alone
Left her in that lonely church yard,
Left my darlin' alone,
Left my gal and left my home
Let Jesus lead you home
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Let's honky tonk all night
Let's lollygag and smooch and love
Let's pretend that time has stopped and I didn't go away
Life can be sad when you're livin' all alone
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
Lights up a purple sky
Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight
Like a flop-eared mule that ain't got no sense
Like a hog a rootin' up under a fence
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
Like echoes from the blue
Like falling rain
Like me I guess he'd like to rest
Like me, he's lost the will to live
Like the flowers in May, she withered away
Like the Master told us to
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Listen poor sinner; you're driftin' away
Little girl, if you're feeling low
Load'er up boys
Locked me to a ball and chain
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
Long is the road that leads you
Lord I don't know what I'll do
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
LORD I NEVER KNEW A MAN COULD FEEL SO BAD,
Lord I take a cost, oh the lost highway
Lord I tried and tried, to keep her satisfied
LORD I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, HE TOOK ONE LOOK,
Lord I wish I had never been born
LORD I'D HAVE TO GET BETTER, BEFORE I COULD DIE.
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
Lord I've tried and I've tried
Lord my head looks like an old chop block
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
LORD THEY'RE KILLIN' ME, I MEAN THEM LOW DOWN BLUES.
Lord what am I comin' to
Lord you better keep it on your mind
Lord, I ain't got nothin' but time
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
Lord, I've tried and I've tried
Lost on the river
Louiville Nashville Montgomery the cap'tal of Ala-bam
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Love like ours should never die so darling let's turn back the years
LOVING YOU AND KNOWING YOU WERE UNTRUE,
Make believe that wrong is right
Make my way among the crowd
Make up your mind to like me and to be my turtledove
Makes no difference what you used to do;
Mama's day with her children is through.
Mama's lying on her dying bed.
Many a night I've cried over you
Mary, she rocked him, her darlin to sleep
May you never be alone like me.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
Maybe you've been cheated in the past,
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
Memories are makin' me blue
Mercy abundantly waits
Met a lad while on my travels
Met my future wife today
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
Mississippi, she's Louisina Bound, of the trains in the southland
Moa-oanin' the blues.
Moa-oanin' The Blues.
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
More precious than diamonds and gold
Mother dearest, darlin' mother
Mother is gone, to her home
Mother's day has turned to night
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over cold dog cause a hot dog's moving in
Move over good dog cause a bad dog's moving in
Move over little dog cause a big dog's movin in
Move over nice dog cause a bad dog's moving in
Move over old dog cause a new dog's moving in
Move over short dog cause a tall dog's moving in
Move over skinny dog cause a fat dog's moving in
My baby stepped out while I was gone
My broken heart cries out for you
My clothes are ragged, no shoes on my feet"
My crop it rotted - in the ground
My darkest night will turn to day
My darlin' I just worship you,
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep I dreamed about mama last night
My dream world fell a part.
My eyes beheld a tragic story
My fishin' pole's broke the creek is full of sand
My folks think i've gone crazy
My friends did say, before she went away
My gal is the village bell
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
My head was swelled up so doggone big I couldn't get it through my front door
My heart is dead and yet i'm living
My helper, he quit - for the lack of pay
My honey coated sweetie pie
My land's so poor - so hard and "yeller"
My life is full of regretting
My life was lost in sinned but in love He took me in
My life will end in deathless sleep
My life with you baby has been one hard knock
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know
My lonely mind wanders back to days that used to be
My Love for You Has turned to hate
My love for you has turned to hate
My mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
My neighbor then smiled and I thought:
My number's in the book
My pants with dirt were sprinkled,
My Shepherd is callin me home.
My shirts they came up wrinkled,
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
My Son Calls Another Man Daddy
My tires and tubes are doin' fine but the air is showin' through
My trial on earth is over now
My wife began her hissin', cut down on her kissin',
My woman run away with another man
My world is honest and true
My yesterdays haunt me, my weary heart cries
My Yvonne the sweetest one me oh my oh
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
Never again will I knock on your door
Never give up hope or cast your pearls and pour this wine wait for the light to shine
Never on this earth to meet no more.
Never was much fun to me
No food upon the table, she said if she was able,
NO FRIENDS IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
No matter how I struggle and strive
No matter what you do
No matter where our footsteps wander
No matter where you wander, darlin'
No more darkness no more night
No more lookin' - I know I been tookin'
No more pain worry sorrow
No more tears, no pain, no woe, in this wicked world below
No more to be sweetheart, no more to be friend
No need for you to set alone,
NO NOT NOW, (no not now), NO NOT NOW, (no not now),
NO NOT NOW, BUT MAYBE NEXT WEEK SOME - HOW.
NO ONE KNOWS THE TORTURE I WENT THROUGH,
No one was there, his body to claim
No one will ever know how much I'm pineing
No one will ever know my heart is breaking
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
No one will miss me, after all
No sad..........farewells
No tear-........... dimmed eyes
No use to sit at home and fine
No-bod-o-dy lonesome for me.
No, they'll never never take her love from me.
nobody is lonesome for me.
Nobody wants to do nothin'
Nor she didn't say goodbye,
Not a penny in my pocket
Not even the angels; in heaven will know
Nothin' seems to make a turn
Nothing but daydreams to haunt me
Nothing seems to turn out right
Now at last you've gone and left me
Now baby, just come on and smile
Now boys don't start to ramblin' round
Now friend if you'll just listen to me you'll get some good hard earned advice
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands
Now he has gone up to Heaven we know
Now he might like what I'm bout to say and my words might make him sore
Now here am I alone and blue
Now here were two grown up people
Now I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib
Now I ain't just talkin' to hear myself cause I've been down that road before
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon
Now I don't wanna show you the door
Now I don't want you here anymore
Now I got rockin' chair money
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Now I know I'll never find another sweetheart
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been
Now I lay awake, dear, with tears in my eyes
Now I went down to the bank this morning,
Now I'm sad, my heart is cryin',
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Now I'm too busy pitchin' woo
Now I've been married about six months,
Now I've learned to slow my temper down and not to pick no scraps no more
Now if you go out and start a playing around
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale,
Now Mary was just a plain mother
Now my clothes are all ragged and torn
Now my gal's short and stubby,
Now my heart is broke it's sad and it's sore
now my key, it don't fit no more
Now my pappy was a fireman and my mammy dear,
Now open your eyes and count with me
Now she don't get my rockin' chair
Now some folks seem to be jealous
Now take the smart aleck in any town of him folks want no part
Now that's what happens when you get too big for your britches
Now the first six months is over, and I am much the older,
Now the last scene is that by the river
Now the man that walks this rocky road usually gets just what he deserves
NOW THE TOUGHEST HIDE GROWS ON A MULE
Now we'll forever be apart
Now when you get to thinkin' you're really smart
Now wrong is wrong and right is right
Now you can go but there's no need to hurry
NOW YOU PICK A PERFECT NIGHT IN JUNE
Now you see these teeth that I ain't got and these knots on my bald head
Now you're gone, our love could never be
Now you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kind-a mad
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.
Now, honey, let's go honky tonkin'
Now, You're Gonna Change or I'm a-gonna leave.
Of a family I once knew.
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
Of a love I thought was true
OF HOW OUR SAVIOR DIED, AS THEY NAILED HIS HANDS,
Of old age and a blushing young bride
Of stitches taken all a - round.
Of the martyrs that have gone
Oh baby rock...rock on down the line
Oh dear brother are you living
Oh don't you know that Jesus died to wash your sins away
Oh heavenly Father help me understand
Oh heavenly Father, help me understand
Oh I gave you love and you broke my heart,
Oh I hear the train a-comin',
Oh listen to that whistle scream
Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train
Oh mother I'm leavin' you here alone
Oh see the greatness of the crowd
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
Oh the blues come around
Oh the day we met, I went astray
Oh the rain is slowly fallin',
Oh you stayed by my side till you got all my money
Oh you're the one that was unfair,
Oh, all the things that might have been
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
Oh, how my poor heart will pine
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
Oh, I shined up my shoes and then I slicked down my hair
Oh, if I can't have you here, I can't go on my dear
Oh, lord, if you hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.
Oh, the blues come around
Oh, the hearts of men shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth.
Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing
Oh, they'll never ever take her love from me.
Oh, where has she gone to, oh, where can she be
Oh! Lord his burdens are greater than mine.
Oh! Lord I cried his burdens are greater than mine.
Oh! Lord I see his burdens are greater than mine.
oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose,
Oh! Plea-ease - don't call me darlin'
Oh! Plea-ease - don't let me love you
Ohio and Kentucky Tennessee and Alabam, the delta state of
Old cupid just gave us a shove
Old cupid just gave us a shove
Old sad yesterday
Ole Dan and I, with throats burned dry,
On a hillside far away
On a stone, these words were written
On an island far away
On an outcast, soon no one will save
On her little face was a look of despair,
On His head the thorns did lay
On his lips, there was a prayer
On that great day I'm going home
On that judgement day; you'll weep and you'll cry
On that resurrection morning
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child.
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain.
On the dixie cannon- ball
On the dixie cannon-ball
On the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball,
On the old log train
On the past let's close the door
On the Tennessee Border
On the Tennessee Border.
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
On who I'd spent my money, turnin' into dy - na - mite,
On your journey to the grave
Once dear I thought
Once he was fair and once he was young
Once I was happy as I could be
Once she called me all her own
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
One night I took a ride just across the line
One time too many I'd rubbed him wrong and he evened up the score
ONE TIME YOU KNOW I LOVED YOU TRUE,
One you say, and ten I see
One-sy, two-sy, zig-sy and
Only a tramp was lazarus sad fate
Only hold her hand and say goodbye
Only six months you see,
Or hopin' and a-waitin'for some rich uncle to die. (deleted 'and')
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Other arms will hold you tight
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Our story's so old again has been told
Out front a colored couple sat and sorrowed yet a while.
Out on the corner standin' so bold
Out on the perilous deep
Out on this river
Out there in that lonesome graveyard
Over there on that other shore.
Packin' and unpackin' your junk
Passed by as it started to rain
Passing by a lonesome graveyard
Paved with all the tribulations
People steal, they cheat and lie
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
Pick guitar fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Plea-ease - stay away from my heart
Please give me a chance, dear, and I'll make amends
Please heed His call and in sin don't fall
Please let her know that I was saved.
Please let me pretend that I am there
Please tell me darlin' why can't you be true
Poor ol' KAW-LIGA, he don't know what he missed
Poor ol' KAW-LIGA, he never got a kiss
Praise the Lord I saw the light.
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life
Praise the Lord, I'll have a new life
Praying for sight
Preacher Just Waitin' for the groom
pretty soon i'll be scratching fleas
Pull yourself together and keep looking for the sign wait for the light to shine
Put on my Sunday suit, but I ain't goin' nowhere
Raised his head, we heard him say.
Raised in the likeness of my Savior
Ready to live in Paradise
Remember pup, before you start to whine
Rock my cradle once again.

Rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
Run along run along don't pester me further
Run along run along don't you pester me further
Said don't make me no coffee Babe,
Said the little paper boy, there on the street
Say Dan can't you see that big green tree,
Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
Sayin' mama please come home
Saying you'd come back and stay
Saying you'd Come back and Stay
says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' long.
Scoot it on over (move it on over)
See her rockin' see her rollin' as she rambles on her way
Sets my sinful soul on fire
Settle down far from town get me a pirogue
Shake it on over (move it on over)
Shame, oh shame - for what you're doin'
She asked me how long I'd remain
She called my name o'er and o'er
She changed the lock on my front door
She didn't do a bit of harm,
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She is sleeping all alone
She just couldn't stand my disgrace
She knows not to speak to my child or to me."
She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line
She leaves the city of the angels headin' for ole Santa Fe
She left LA this mornin' burnin' up the right of way
She left the sink a'saggin',
She left this world with a smile on her face
She made me for my money and she made me blue
She may have forsaken some other like me
She never close her eyes to sleep till we were all in bed
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
She promised to honor, to love and obey
She read me the Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
SHE SAID I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU, IF ALL THE REST WERE DEAD.
She said, "son, please don't leave me
She seemed to fear that the world might harm the ones that she loved the best
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
She stopped and I knew right away
She tagged along through right and wrong
She told me not to play around
She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
She took me in her arms
She warned me once, she warned me twice
She was her daddy's only daughter
She was somebody's darling and pride
She will bloom in the Master's bouquet.
She'd cook something bye and bye,
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's a makin' nauts she's makin' time just watch her swing and sway
She's gone to meet Daddy up there in heaven
She's got "purty" eyes of blue
She's got that kind of lovin'
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue
She's on her way to doom
She's strong as she can be,
She's sweeter than wine and brother she's mine
She's the beauty of the southlands listen to that whistle scream
She's watching and waiting alone
Should you go first and I remain for battles to be fought
Should you go first and I remain one thing I'll have you do
Should you go first and I remain to finish with the scroll
Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
Shoutin' get up the oxens
Simple tunes are hard to sing
Since my baby said goodbye
Since the day that we met you've been nothin' but trouble
Since the day that we met you've been nothin' but worry
Sinner hear me when I say
Sinner hear now what I say
Sinner man won't you stop now and pray
Sinner, hear me when I say
Sitting alone in my prison cell
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Six more miles to the graveyard,
Six more miles, long and sad,
Six more miles, to the graveyard,
Skies above are dark and stormy
Sneak it on over (move it on over)
So - after all, ever'thing's in purty good shape."
So baby, if you wanna shine
So baby, if you wants to shine
So baby, just come along with me
So blue the nights, so blue the days
So brother keep on prayin' and follow where you're lead
So come and ride that glorious train
So come around next fall
So don't take off your hat and coat
So ease it on over (move it on over)
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
So get it on over (move it on over)
So he went to work and when he got through he'd knocked every one of my teeth out
So heavy is my load
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts
So I can get me somethin' to eat
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.
So I won't be home no more
So I'll follow all the way
So I'll say goodbye dear till tomorrow
So I'm gonna tell you goodbye,
So I'm satisfied with you.
So if you wanna have fun, come along with me
So if you're ever sad and lonely
So kiss her every mornin' and love her every night
So many times you've proved that in the past
So now that she is leavin'
So pack it on over (move it on over)
So remember they're your brothers
So run along, I know that you don't want me
So scratch it on over (move it on over)
SO SELFISH ARE WE, FOR SILVER AND GOLD,
So she could never answer "YES" or "NO".
So shove it on over (move it on over)
So slide it on over (move it on over)
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell
So that you and I could live
So there'll be no teardrops tonight.
So this world would not be lost
So trustin' in God's love, I'll meet her above
So try to repent and ask for forgiveness
So why should we try anymore
So you fool ev'ry new love you find
So, swing wide your gate of love, open it for me
So, Why Don't You Love Me like you used to do.
Some don't seem to care
Some folks might sa-ay that I'm no good
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree
Some glad day I'm going home
Some joy I will bring
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
Some people struggle for riches
Some were propers some were kings and some were masters of the arts
Somebody else stood by your side
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue
Someday you'll be so lonely and blue
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
Someday you'll reach for me I won't be there
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
Someone has fell by the way
Something Got A Hold Of Me (Praise God)
Sometimes I get so weary inside
Sometimes it's har-rd but you gotta understand
son it's gonna stay on your mind
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Soon I'll cross that dark river
Speak once again of my love, my own
Standing with all the angels on a golden stair
Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three.
Stick your head out the window and feel that southern breeze
Still hears my broken song of love
Still I know I claim you for my own
Still live in my heart all alone
Stood a little paper boy so hungry and cold
Stop doin' all the things that you oughten too
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Strange as it seems, somehow I love you yet
Such a beautiful dream
Such love as Jesus did impart
Sundown and sorrow have found me
Sunflow'rs waitin' for the sunshine
Sunshine or rain
Super-duper (Rootie Tootie)
Sure death is hovering nigh
Swap my mon, to buy Yvonne what she need-oh
Sweep it on over (move it on over)
Sweetheart, remember when your world gets lonesome
Swing wide the gate and leave it open
Swing wide your gate of love and please don't let me fall
Swing wide your gate of love, open wide up your heart
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Take this message to my mother
Teardrops fell the night you said
Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks,
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep,
tell her that I've met my saviour
Tell me where you think we're goin'
Ten little numbers and a boogie time
than a country mile;
Than change you for somebody new.
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Thank God for all the mountains and the seas
Thank God for ev'ry flower and each tree
Thank God for givin' life to you and me
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
That dreams will soon come true
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men
That for you ain't got nothin' but time
That I should be ashamed to take you 'round
That I was glad the day you set me free
That I was glad to see you go
That I was stringin' you along
That I will never know contentment
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
That I'd be happy if we'd part
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind
That last long day she said goodbye
That meant more to me than thou
That might have been happy some day
THAT MULE AIN'T BOTHERED WITH AN ITCH...FLY TROUBLE
That never should have been said
That old log train
THAT OLE MOON ABOVE, WAS JUST MADE FOR LOVE,
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
That should be ringing out for you and me
That showed thru the darkest of nights.
That side's yours and this side's mine
That the old-time religion was real
That the saints have travelled on
That their gold and silver will melt away
That they called Chapman Town
That time has turned the tide
That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were alright
That tomorrow you'll be wed,
That waits beside the track
That we lost our baby, at the first fall of snow
That we shared together in the used to be
That we should have admitted before
That weddin' bells won't cure
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong
That woman of mine she wouldn't let me in
That you have been true
That you'll be back before so long
That you're ready to meet
That you've been seen - a-runnin' 'round
That's all she wrote, Dear John,
That's home sweet home to me,
That's just a picture from life's other side
That's the place i long to be,
That's what's the matter with me
That's where I long to be
That's where my sweetheart's sleepin'
That's why we're so far apart
The Angel of Death
The angels came for her, at the first fall of snow
The bar-fly's waitin' for an easy mark
The beachcomber's waitin' for the ride. (tide)
The bees got mad - and they left the hive
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The blood is white and spouting steam
The blues come around when the sun goes down
the boys all whistle when she walks by.
The canned stuff's spoiled - else the jar's got broke
The cashier said with a grin,
The ceremony was over
The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out:
The children're all with you now the kindly doctor said
The chimney fell down - just yesterday
The cigar smoke, and some of these wonderful songs
The city slicker's waitin' for the country boy
The congregation's waitin' for the preacher
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The cow's gone dry - and them hens won't lay
The crooner's Just Waitin' to sing
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
The Devil's Train is long and black
The Devil's Train will take you
The dreams that we knew can never come true
The durn rabbits - they got the turnip greens
The durned old mule - he tore down the fence
The fairest young maiden that I ever saw
The fire fell from Heaven, I fell to the floor
The first scene is that of a gambler
The first three months, was all OK,
The folks would come runnin'
The good Lord only knows what I go through
The grass in the valley is starting to die
The groom's Just Waitin' for the June bride
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The Holy One so dear
The house it leaks - it needs a new top
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby,
The judge will give me the 'lectric chair
The jug runs dry and still I cry
The kisses we steal we know are not real
The life-termer's waitin' for a prison break
The light shine bright from yer window
The little boy was gone and they wondered why
The little paper boy who died in the snow
The log train is silent
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles,
The lovelight in your eyes has faded
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
The man picked up a monkey wrench and WHAM!, he changed my tune
The mean old freight train blues.
The mem'ry of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope
The midnight train is whining low
The moon just went behind the clouds
The moon was shinin' there
The moonshiner's waitin' at the still
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
The mortgage is due and - I can't pay
The news is out - all over town
The nights are cool and I'm a fool.
The old cow's standin' by the Bull Durham sign
The old maid's waitin' for leap year to come
The ones it hurts the most
The only one I'd fool is me
The past is a flower, that withers and dies
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
The place I left long, long ago
The porch rotted down - that's more expense
The preacher's comin' Sunday - to spend the day
THE RICH MAN LIKE ALL, WILL BE JUDGED AT THAT TIME,
The right to his love, I've been denied.
The river of life
The rose I wore was red
The roses have faded, there's frost at my door
The roses were bloomin' there on the Border
The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man
The seeds of distrust, it will sow
The shadows sway and seem to say
The silence of a falling star
The simple things have gone forever
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face, showed the wisdom and ignorance of a crushed, undying race.
The snow falls 'round my window
The stars up above you look down in your eyes
The story to me you revealed
The tear will dry the rose will wither
The tears and sorrow I have caused her
The things you didn't calculate
The time now ain't long; when the Saviour will come
The time will come
The trees played the waltz of the wind
The trees stand so silent and still
The vows that we make are only to break
The was a time I thought you loved me
The way I do
The way to keep a woman happy
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
The well's gone dry and I have to tote the water
The white hat, the high-heeled boots
The whole night through
The words said Mother is gone.
The words were Mother is gone.
The world with me might sympathize
Them jumpin honky tonk blues,
Then after she'd exploded, her meanness all unloaded,
Then all God's faithful children will raise up from the dead
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
Then give thanks for all your blessin's
Then I began to wonder, if I had made a blunder,
Then I bow my head and weep
Then I hurry straight home and pack
Then i know what you're dreamin' of
Then i know what you're thinkin' of
Then I recall how my Jesus died
then I turned away and cried again
Then I'll stop moanin'; Moa-oanin' The Blues.
Then if you no longer care
THEN IT'S USELESS TO YOU, IF YOU'VE STRAYED FROM THE FOLD,
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
Then on that judgement morning when all pain has fled
Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
Then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
Then one day something happened
Then read aloud just to myself
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
Then the Angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Then the gods would deny you on the great judgement day.
Then the Parson came over and took his hand
Then there'll be no teardrops tonight.
Then will you be ready to go home
Then you cry and ask the judge won't you please turn him loose
Then you have a big policeman drag me back home
Then you will know just how much I love you
Then you'll be judged; by the deeds you have done
Then you'll be ready to go home
Then you'll moanin'; Moa-oanin' The Blues.
Then you're just like the dirt beneath their feet
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him atlast.
Then's when you'll wish; you had Jesus nigh
There ain't a thing you can do but sit at home and cry
There all my fears and tears were lost
There he was lying but he felt no pain
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
There in your arms, with all of your charms
There is no end, I can't pretend
There is one smiling face the gods would see
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through
There lies a story on a rose.
There remains the Glory Fountain
There sat my Saviour on his golden throne
There sat your picture all alone
There was a note upon my door,
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
THERE WAS NO ONE HIS PAIN TO EASE,
THERE WAS NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO,
There wasn't nothin' I could do
There ya have it, friends
There'll be gathered there great armies for that battle on that day.
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars.
There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war.
There'll be no more sorrow
There'll be no more strife
There'll be no one then to dry your tears.
There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
There'll come a time in your life dear
There's a lamp light in the window
There's a mighty battle coming and it's well now on its way.
There's a poor old mother at home
There's a road that's straight and narrow
There's a singin' waterfall
THERE'S A STORY OLD, THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN TOLD,
There's a tear in my beer
There's a tear in my beer
There's always somebody smarter than you
There's be a lot more honest loving
There's be no pain or sorrow, no tears will e'er be shed
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
There's comin' a day when the world shall melt away
There's more fish in the sea
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my life for a sigh
There's no room in my memory for tears
There's no use to pretend
There's no use to try anymore
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby
There's pictures of love and of passion
There's soda pop and the dancing's free
There's someone who's restin' alone
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see
there's water... cool, clear water.
These blues have got me cryin'
These doggone blues never make me cry
These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time
These wasted tears are souvenirs
These words he said with tears in his eyes
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight,
They nailed his hands there on the cross
They need a helpin' hand.
They pierced his side and then his feet
They sang like they meant it, they all clapped their hands
They say the road of love is long
They started searchin' and then found him dead
They strengthened their own selfish pride
They tell me little darlin',
They took me off the Georgia Main
They won't leave you alone till they've got your last dollar
They would change their way of livin'
They're gone to return no more
They're leavin' on that Devil's Train
Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin'
Thiinking of you
Things have changed, you'd rather fight than eat
Think of days that are gone dear
This ain't right and that is wrong
This city life has really got me down
This dog house here is mighty small
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands
This heart of mine - could never see
This is all I can say
This is the dreaded hour
This old log train
this one is the queen, all the way from Cincinnati down to New Orleans.
This prisoner here before you is a social enemy
This rockin' chair money, honey
This story happened
This trial on earth was for my soul
this world
This world holds nothin' for me
Tho' the years pass on in sorrow
Those Broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too many pals
Those wedding bell will never ring for me
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
Those who seek it will recieve it, mercy at the Savior's feet.
Though his leg was very crippled
Though life to him had been unkind
Though our paths in life have parted
Through valleys, o'er mountains and plains
Thru tears I watch young lovers
Til my body's just a shell
Til' I hear an old train rollin' down the line
till I can't move a toe
Till one day I was toted home and mama didn't know her little boy
Till we dance to the waltz of the wind
To a land of groans and pain
To always remain
To anyone who's fool enough to fall ...
To bully folks and play mean tricks was once my pride and joy
To Canaan's land I'm on my way
To claim the Saviour for your own
To count like Caesar when Caesar's dead
To drift from pillar to post
To find a life that's new
To find the best deal in town.
To give you a heart true and real
To hide its face and cry
To lay all his money down.
To live forever more, just o'er on heaven's shore
To live in when this life is o'er
To live with Him up there around the throne
To rock on away from here
To see my Uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
to some poor sinner man
To spend eternity
To supply our every need
To take her into town
To take it the rest of my life.
To that beautiful home up there
To the Lord be praise and glory, forever, let us pray.
To the one he had loved thru the years.
To the tune of the ALABAMA WALTZ.
To travel a land of hunger and pain
To walk through that front door
To wash all my sins and call me His own
to water... cool, clear water.
TO YOUR EARTHLY WEALTH, YOU MUST SAY GOODBYE,
To-day I tried to eat a steak with a big old table-spoon
Today as she walked arm in arm
Today his mother shares a new love
Today I passed you on the street
Today the tempest rolls high
Today's the day you start to pay
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin' settin' the woods on fire
Tomorrow you'll be
Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell
Tonight down here in the valley
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'
Tonight my heart is bowed in sorrow
Tonight we pray for water.... cool, clear water
Too many boyfriends and sociable sals may drive your sweetheart away
Too many broken vows and promises
Too many parties and too many pals will break your heart someday
Too many tears thru it all
Too many times I've watched my castles fall
TOOK MY GAL TO THE PICTURE SHOW, JUST THE OTHER DAY,
Tootsie-wootsie, (Rootie Tootie)
Tote it on over (move it on over)
Towards the center of your heart I'll be bound
Travelin' down a lonely highway
Traveling through this world alone
Tryin' hard to play the game
Trying to take me back please
Turn back before its to late
Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see,
United in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.
until I'm petrified.
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
Up from the spring - about a mile and a quarter
Up there I know, there'll be no pain
Up there I'll meet my darlin'
Up there no tears will blind my eyes
Up there, I pray I'll find contentment
Upsy-daisy, (Rootie Tootie)
Violets Just Waitin' for dew
Wait for the light to shine wait for the light to shine
Waitin' for a call from a big quiz show
Walk slowly down that long long path for soon I'll follow you
WALKED MY GAL HOME TO THE DOOR, AND ASKED HER FOR A KISS,
Waltz, Waltz, the ALABAMA WALTZ
Was the only daughter of an en-gin-eer,
Watching the setting sun
Way down in the southland
Way off in the distance
Way up in heaven above
We all must face someday
We always fuss and fight
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree
We can find us a brand new recipe?
We danced to the ALABAMA WALTZ.
We don't get nearer or further
We don't get nearer or further or closer
We drift like a wave from the shore
We fight and we fuss like a dog and a cat
We had our love to make us happy it wasn't meant to bring us tears
We had our love to make us happy...
We hid from the shower an hour or so
We hope you like our version of 'em
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
We live in two different worlds, dear
We lived in a place
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes
We wanted wealth to call our own
We were happy, oh so happy little darlin'
We were just victims of a half-hearted love
We were so happy, darlin' we two
We'd meet there ev'ry Ev'nin'
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
We'll call them Mary and William
We'll go and lose them blues
We'll go Honky Tonkin' 'round this town
We'll go Honky Tonkin' 'round this town.
We'll have us a time oh brother settin' the woods on fire
We'll let bygones be forgotten souvenirs
We'll meet beyond the blue.
We'll meet in heaven some glad day. ...
We'll meet up in heaven, someday.
We'll order up two bowls of chili settin' the woods on fire
We'll put aside a little time to fix a flat or two
We'll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done
We'll sit close to one another up one street and down the other
We'll take in all the honky tonks tonight we're havin' fun
We're getting closer to the grave each day
We're goin' to the city - to the city fair
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of May
We've known so much of happiness we've had our cup of joy
Weary blues from waitin'
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Weeping as they lay my darling
Well I heard the dishes crashin',
Well I left my home down on the rural route
Well I stopped into every place in town
Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
Well I'm standin' on a corner - With a bucket in my hand
Well Lord I got 'em,
Well Lord I got em,
Well lord I thought I would cry
Well Lord I thought I would cry
WELL MY FRIEND IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.
Well she didn't forward no address,
Well shut my mouth, i'm a'headin' south,
Well shut my mouth, i'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannon-ball
Well then she started cryin', I felt myself a'sighin',
Well then she started naggin',
Well when I woke up this mornin',
Well, I ain't got nothin' but time
Well, I said I would leave if you didn't change
Well, I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
Well, I went upon the mountain - I looked down in the sea
Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine.
Well, me and my baby - we just bought a Ford
Well, there ain't no use - of me workin' so hard
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be
Well, Why Don't You Love Me like you used to do
Well, you're just in time to be too late
Well, you're just in time to celebrate
Well, you're just in time to turn around
what a blessed picnic this here baby got today.
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
What a happy feelin' to know He'll always care
What can I do - you win again.
What can i do love with my heart
What can I do, love, with my heart
What can i do, where can i go
What ev'rybod - y knew but me
What good is gold and silver too
What good is gold and silver, too
What in the confounded cat hair you want me to do
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
What pain He suffered there
What will you do; when the Saviour ain't nigh
What's the use to bother your head
What's the use to deny we've been living a lie
What's the use to say that you're no good
When all dead in Christ shall rise
When everything goes wrong
WHEN FLOWERS ARE BLOOMIN BENEATH THE MOON
When God comes and gathers his jewels
When God comes and gathers his jewels.
When God dips His love in my heart
When God dips His pen of love in my heart
When He said forgive them Father
When He says come unto Me, will your soul be clean and free
When I agree with you baby it makes you mad and when I don't it makes you sad
When I argue back you pack and leave and when I don't you pout in grieve
When I can't get you off of my mind.
When i cross them smokey mountains. i'll be countin' every mile,
When I face the judge of eternity
When I get to Glory I'll see no more
When I get to Glory, I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
When I get to Glory, I'm Gonna sing, sing, sing.
When I get to Glory, I'm gonna sing, sing, sing.
When I got a woman - in the boss man's yard.
When I got thru with all my lies
When I know you don't love me
When I pass by all the people say
When I said I do, she must have read my thinkin',
When i see them treetops tall,
When I try I'm just wastin' my time
When I'd crawl back if I could
When I'm lonely, I want you only
When it rains - it wets ever'thing we got
When leaves begin to die?
When my baby moved out and the blues moved in
When my life here is o'er I'm going home
When my work here is o'er
When old Gabriel blows his trumpet
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine
When she signs that dotted line
when slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
WHEN SOMETHIN BIGHTS YOU ON THE NOSE...FLY TROUBLE
When tears come down
When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
When the Angel of Death
When the ev'nin' train goes by
When the evenin' sun is sinking
When the lights all grow dim
When the Lord made me, He made a Ra-amblin' Man
When the Lord made me, He made a Ramblin' Man
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
When the road is rocky and you're carrying the load wait for the light to shine
When the seals are broken and names are read aloud
When the sky shall open and this earth melt away
When the sun was low
When the Sun was sinkin' low
When the time comes to die
When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die
When the whistle blows, i'll be on my toes,
WHEN THE WORLD IS ON FIRE, ON THAT JUDGEMENT DAY,
When things go wrong, you go your way
When things start runnin' smooth and free
When time goes crawling by
When we meet our love ones there
When we stand there in God's Kingdom and The Book Of Life Is Read.
When we walk around the square
When you and your baby have a fallin' out
When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
When you hair has turned from Gold to Silver
When you know I love you so
When you left I hung my head down and I cried
When you need a friend to go with you all the way
When you promised to be mine alone
When you wear your veil of white
When you whispered, "Dear, I worship thee!"
When you'll be blue
When you'll be laid
When you'll need someone who will care
When you're alone and blue tonight my little darlin'
When you're home and darlin'
When you're not in my arms
When you're tired of breaking other hearts
When you're wearing striped britches,
When you've strayed from the fold
When your dream world falls around you
When your heart's not good and true
When your soul is burdened down
When your soul is lost in sin
When your soul is weary and it seems you've lost your way
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
Where all is joy, peace and love
Where all..........is joy
Where an angel from above
Where dangers silently creep
Where happiness is free
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Where is the dream I once knew
Where sorrow creeps
Where the cotton grows and the suwanee flows,
Where the redeemed of God shall stand
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul.............never dies.
Where the soul........never dies
Where the soul........never dies.
where the water's runnin' free.
Where the white roses turn to red."
Where there will be no parting hand
where there's no quest
Where they meet you and they greet you,
Where will you live after death
Where you´ll never, never die
Wherever you lead me, I'm willin' to go
Wherever you may be, Thank God.
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones
While my precious darling's sleeping
While she's circlin' through the canyons, can't you see that mountain stream
While strolling thru a lovely garden
While the angels tend the garden of the big plantation ground.
While you set alone and cry.
Whisp'ring the Saviour's name
Who failed to use common sense
Who had lost all of his money at play
Who is a legend
Who ran a log train
Whom God has called back to the fold
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
Why do we stay together
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why don't you act a little older
Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do.
Why Don't You Love Me like you used to do.
Why don't you mind your own business
why don't you mind your own business
Why don't you say the things you used to say
Why don't you spark me like you used to do
Why don't you write to me and say;
why I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips.
Why meet a terrible fate
Why should I cry, I never done you wrong
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
Why the Lord took her away.
Why when I married you, you were such a meek little thing
Why, oh why - should you desert me
Why, oh why do we keep tryin'
Wicky-wacky, (Rootie Tootie)
Will come from the sky
Will he take you by the hand and lead you to that promised land
Will I always be a dreamer dreaming of the used to be
will leave my eyes.
Will make you weep
Will pine some day
Will they meet again tomorrow where we parted yesterday
Will you be ready to go, ready to go home
Will you move to that beautiful city
Will you move to this Heavenly Home.
Will you please make up your mind
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do
Winter or summer
With a drunken engineer
with a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque.
With a welcome on the door
With dishes piled up high,
With his eyes lifted to'ard heaven
With just a teardrop on a rose.
With my sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew,
With no one to call my own
With out the taste of water... cool, water.
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat
WITH SOMETHIN' A CIRCLIN' ROUND YA HEAD
With such tender care and love.
WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES, ON THE CROSS THERE HE DIED,
With tears in my eyes, dear, I begged you to stay
With the pride that came between us
With the sweetest how you are,
With your dying breath
Woke up this mornin wishin I could lose
won't hurt me so.
Won't it be so bright and fair
Won't it be so sweet, to rest at Jesus' feet
Won't you come back again and break mine
Won't you come over in mine
Won't you redeem; your poor wicked soul
Won't you sometimes think of me
Wondering what I could do
Words that you told me
Worm must be waitin' for the early bird
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Would you lend a helping hand
Would you stand and shout his name or bow your head in shame
would you stop and try to save
YA BRACE YA SELF AN YA COURAGE GROWS
Yea! My Bucket's Got A Hole In It
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Years have passed since that parting
Yes I knew the day I lost you
Yes I received your note today
Yes I received Your note today
Yes Something Got A Hold Of Me (Oh! Lord)
Yes, his burdens are greater than mine.
Yes, i'm goin' back to dixie, that's the place i long to be,
Yes, thy burdens are greater than mine.
Yet there's consolation in my heart
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Yet, he smiled in understandin'
Yipsy-doodle, (Rootie Tootie)
You ain't never known to be wrong
You are on my lonely mind
You are on my lonely mind.
you are on my lonely mind.
You believe that a true love is blind
You better call her sweet mama,
You better heed this warning,
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better start to treat me nice
You can find it in the temple
You can see this lad all alone
YOU CAN TREASURE YOUR WEALTH, YOUR DIAMONDS AND GOLD,
You can't pay your way; with Silver and Gold
You clap hands and I'll start bowin' we'll do all the laws allowin'
You could hear the train blow
You couldn't forgive me, so you went away
You didn't care enough, to even say goodbye
You didn't even know, the chances you were takin'
You don't care whose life you ruin
You don't dress up in satin,
You don't feel love
You don't want real love
You don't wear diamond rings,
You done kicked me till I feel like a used football
YOU FAN THE AIR AS HE GOES BY
You gave the best years of your life dear
You give away your kisses
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight
You got me chasin Rabbits, pickin' out rings and Howlin' At The Moon
You got me chasin' Rabbits, pullin' out my hair and Howlin' At The Moon.
You got me chasin' Rabbits, scratchin' fleas and Howlin' At The Moon.
You got me chasin' Rabbits, spittin' out teeth and Howlin' At The Moon.
You got me chasin' Rabbits, walkin' on my hands
You gotta treat her nice and kind
You haul right off and you pick on me
You have no heart - you have no shame
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
You have to set on a sack of fetilizer to raise an "umbreller"
YOU HAVE TREATED ME SO BAD,
You holler good and loud put him in the calaboose
You just keep naggin', all the day long
You just look through your cookbook
YOU KILLED ALL THE LOVE I EVER HAD.
You knew I worshipped you, right from the start
You knock me down and then you pick me up
You know ev'rything comes to a standstill
You know friends I wonder--
You know I miss you, now that you're gone
You know she didn't ask to be brought to
You know that you are free to go dear
You know that you're the one to blame
You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
You know, we finally call him the "Old Man"
You laughed inside each time she cried
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AND RUN AROUND,
You leave me here, to pay and pay
You left me with a heart so sick and sore.
You lived on promises I knew would fall apart
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,
You looked me up I turned you down
You made your world out of vows that are broken
You may ramble and ramble this whole wide world over
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top
You never would admit you were mis-tak-en
You no longer care for me but when you're happy with another
You only build me up to let me down
You pack your rags and go back to dad
You pass right through then all when your New Orleans bound.
You promised darlin' that we'd never part
YOU ROLL THE PAPER UP NICE AND TIGHT
You said that you no longer loved me
You said you could live without loving
You say get out and I'd better stay gone
YOU SHAKE YA HEAD AN TWITCH YA NOSE
You should have known you'd be alone
You should see the people stare
You sing loud and I'll sing louder tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
You smiled when your heart told you to weep
You start your jaws a-wagging and it never stop
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You take true love - and give the blame
You tell him lies he don't belie-ieve
You thought she'd care for you and so you acted smart
You thought that you would hurt me,
You threw away
You told her lies and alibis
You told me I was wrong, you thought that you were smart
You told me that our love was true
You told me you loved me, you told me a lie
You tried and lost, now pay the cost
You tried to make her blue
You tried to pretend that you were happy
You wanted me to see you change your name
You were just playing a game
YOU WERE THE TALK OF THE TOWN,
You were there in my arms alone in the moonlight
You wore out a brand new trunk
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You'll always know him by the lonesome fiddle
You'll be broke but I'll be broker tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
You'll be moanin' and a groanin',
You'll be singing blue and lonesome,
You'll cry and cry
You'll dig up the money or you'll work the streets
You'll find that life is still worth while
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair
You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You'll remember darling what I told you
You'll see many loved ones standin' in the crowd
You'll sometimes think of me
You'll spend your days in sorrow
You'll stand in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.
You'll toss around
You'll walk the floor
You're asking me for sympathy
You're drifting to far from the shore
You're Gonna Change or I'm a-gonna leave.
You're gonna change your way of livin'
You're just in time to be too late
You're just in time to change your tune
You're just in time to miss the boat
You're just tryin'
You're my gal and I'm your feller dress up in your frock of yeller
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You're not buyin'
You're not made out of candy
You're only lookin' around
You're warned of the day
You're Window Shoppin'
You're Window Shoppin' that's all.
You've got a true love in your heart
YOU'VE GOT AN AWFUL BAD CASE OF THEM LOW DOWN BLUES.
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
You've hurt me but no one will ever know
You've known so long that you were wrong
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
You've reached your journey's end
Your baby's gonna tear your playhouse down
Your cheatin' heart
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you...
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some and all I do is moan
Your daddy's mad; He's done got pee-eeved
Your evil heart will be your ruin
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
Your heart is yearning for an old love
Your memory is chained to me
your on that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.
Your wedding day will be tomorrow
